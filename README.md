# Anagram Program

#### Ahmed Khokar

## Description

A program in which the user inputs a word to match from, and then a list of words to check for anagrams and partial anagrams.


### Specs

1.The program will take a match word from the user: <br>
*EXAMPLE:*<br>
"Welcome to Anagram Match! Enter your word to match from: "<br>
<b>Input</b>:  "beard"<br>
<b>Output</b>: "Enter one word at a time and type 'match' to check matches against original word:"<br>

2.The program will take subsequent words from the user:<br>
*EXAMPLE:*<br>
"Enter one word at a time and type 'match' to check matches against original word:"
<b>Input</b>: "bread"<br>
<b>Output</b>:"Enter one word at a time and type 'match' to check matches against original word:" <br>

3.The program will give the user a list of the anagram matches once the user finishes typing in words to add to the list. 
*EXAMPLE:*<br>
<b>Input</b>:"match"<br>
<b>Output</b>:"These are the matches for 'beard'<br><br>"bread"
<br>
